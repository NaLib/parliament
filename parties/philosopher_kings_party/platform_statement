All representatives of this party shall be voluntarily subject to logging of their activities (meaning advertised transparency) which is reviewed by a committee of democratically elected members of the constituency to ensure honest action.

Representatives are selected based on oratory presentation of philosophical insights, and a record of NOT seeking power or using deceptive techniques.

The party’s chief objective is the rebuilding of the Library of Alexandria as a sovereign campus unto itself for the noblest citizens to dwell in a monastic lifestyle of intellectual pursuit of the Good. Truth and Beauty are it’s highest virtues, and it seeks to create millions of jobs in service to these virtues.

Our first objective is to cleanse the media people consume, because, as Plato pointed out in his Republic, bad art corrupts the youth by hijacking their brains’ pleasure centers. We believe that we must use media to heal our populus, and guard against corrupting media, which has been used as subtle mind control recently, and which is getting out of hand in the digital age.

Also, we will hire all of this board’s best OSINT diggers and memers as full time employees of our multimedia news service.
